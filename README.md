### Background

This project aims to evaluate multiple load-balancing algorithms on the effect of server utilization of multiple different server models.

### Files

The files in this repo are outlined below

1. [data]()
   1. [anon_jobs_2020-08.json.bz2](anon_jobs_2020-08.json.bz2) - this is one month of data from the Eagle super computer. (See [here](#data).)

### Data

This contains all the data files used for the simulation.

Source for the real world data come from NERL's Eagle supercomputer. Link to the data [here](https://data.nrel.gov/submissions/152).

Additionally, data from Northeastern University's Discovery cluster was provided to us. This data is not publicly available. More info available [here](https://rc.northeastern.edu/). This is the `discovery-data.csv.bz2` file, which is a trimmed down version of the original dataset featuring only relevant information necessary for this project.
