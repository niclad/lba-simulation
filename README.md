### Background

This project aims to evaluate multiple load-balancing algorithms on the effect of server utilization of multiple different server models.

### Data

This contains all the data files used for the simulation.

Source for the real world data come from NERL's Eagle supercomputer. Link to the data [here](https://data.nrel.gov/submissions/152).
